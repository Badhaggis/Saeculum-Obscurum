Saeculum-Obscurum
=================

Good Morning.

You have been selected especially to contribute to the towering ediface that is SAECULUM OBSCURUM!

*cough*

Now, to buissness gentlemen (and quite possibly women, who knows?).

This Githubby thingy is for keeping everything upto date (thank riknap for moaning at me), and can allow anyone (who I chose) to contribute to the project.

Pretty neat.

Anyway, if you edit something, please for the love of [insert diety of your choice] say what you've edited or I'll get horribly confused and grumpy.

Anyway, I can't really think of anything else to say for the moment, given that I have absolutly no idea how this works (thanks riknap again).

...

Roman Invictus!
